============
*8.00 pm, CEP ground floor*

Absentees: `None`

This meeting was called impromptu to change a few norms that we discussed before. Firstly, the platform to keep the documentation and MOM was under debate. We have finalized to use git and markdown for our MOMs. Secondly, we have decided to maintain a daily personal log of our work and update it on git **(send a PR) latest by Sunday**.
*This does not mean the team member cannot push multiple times during a week. But he is expected to have at least one PR in a week.*
To maintain transparency in our work and duties. System test plan, design and coding related work to be assigned next week.

#### Update in tasks and deadlines:
* Collect a minimum of 20 surveys per person before 2nd March.
* All other tasks and deadlines remain same as before.
