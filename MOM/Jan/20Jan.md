*6.00 pm, CEP ground floor*

Absentees: `None`


Agenda:
We all came up with a few ideas and decided to defend them. The plan was each person puts forward his ideas, and the other team members become critics. After doing this exercise, we all dropped various ideas and shortlisted 3 ideas for further discussion. The reason for dropping these ideas were: there was no proper client available; the idea was already implemented; the idea was not deliverable in the given amount of time; we lacked technical knowledge which made the idea not feasible. Few ideas which were shortlisted were as follows:

Open source maps which helps you scribble on them, note memories and share these memories.
Collegeâ€™s own programming judge.
A research portal for DAIICT research done till now, connecting the students and professors on common grounds in terms of research.
A student dashboard which can be personalized and can help him customize various widgets.
