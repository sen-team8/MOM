Absentees: `None`

This meetings was held to discuss all the prepared documents with the mentor, specifically the SRS. Ms. Rupsa gave valubale suggestions to us
in terms of correcting minor errors. We sat together to work on the SRS and project plan after the suggestion changes.
### Few changes mentor proposed are as follows:
* Update the surveys in a visual pleasing format. (Pie charts and not bar graphs)
*  Mention the actual convention used. Even for updating the versions.


### Other tasks given to all individuals were:
- Reading all the documents thoroughly
- Reading the agile model.
