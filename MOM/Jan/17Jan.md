Agenda:
This was the first meeting where we introduced ourselves and the group members of the team. We also talked about the various projects and development each one of us is exposed to. This included in-depth  discussion of their past projects, technologies they have worked with and the team-size they were involved working with previously. Each of us benefited from this discussion in some way or the other, we got to know the strengths and weaknesses of the team, and points where we would need to put significant efforts in order to successfully carry out this project. We decided to brainstorm after going back, and come with ideas, or potential problems we can target, so as to come up with a concrete plan to propose in the coming weeks.
